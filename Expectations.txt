I like html. 
CMSC 100 is about html.
Using the modus ponen's law we can conclode: I like CMSC 100. 

I expect to like it.
I expect to be able to design funny websites.
I expect some of these can hopefully be used in my resume.
I expect to forget to avail my pokedollers again. 
I expect to get at least a dos here. 
that is all.
